To Do

-----
using a graph to encode the connectivity of the surface. The way the points of the surface are defined is NOT correct. The
position should be sampled from all available positions for ants moving in the world. And the connectivity based on their
movement dynamics. However, we then need to account for the fact that at some positions we may not be able to add a pellet 
or pick one up. So be it.

Pickup: always 2 positions are added. Connectivity checks with neighbours done after.
Drop: up to 26 positions added. Connectivity checks with neighbours done after.

Of course this will add some complexity. I hope its not too bad.

Do it in a seperate repo where you keep only the essentials from this one. Code it up nicely.
